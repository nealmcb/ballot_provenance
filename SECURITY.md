# Reporting Security Issues

We take security bugs seriously.
We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/nealmcb/ballot_provenance/security/advisories/new) tab.

The team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement,
and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.
